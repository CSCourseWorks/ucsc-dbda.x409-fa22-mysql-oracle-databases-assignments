# A dynamic stored procedure to process constraints using the cursor in the studentdb database.

Questions:
1. Primary key can not be deleted. Why?
2. How to add constraints back with new names after deletion? (All the information has been deleted)
3. I try to use triggers to track the deleted information. But the error occurs, saying that the root user has no access to the information_schema database. Why?
